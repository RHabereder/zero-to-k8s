# Zero-To-k8s

This project tries to ease the creation of a local Kubernetes environment, including all the awesome devops tools you can possibly need. 
It should be as easy as a "./startup.sh" to get you up and running and a "k3d delete --name dev" to clean up again. 

If anything you like is missing, hit me up! I love learning new awesome tools!

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them:

```none
Docker
Dialog (If you are lazy, like me)
```

What this script was tested on:

```none
WSL (Frequently, since this is my main driver for development-stuff)
Ubuntu
MacOS 10.15
```

What it hopefully runs on one day:

```none
Git Bash/MinGW (This one is pretty hard to work with actually. It randomly dislikes rm'ing stuff and borks the permissions so a relog is needed)
```

### Installing

Edit startup.sh and add/remove stuff you need/want in

```bash
#Possible Single Values: tekton,rio,drone,concourse
CI="tekton"

#Possible Single Values: traefik,traefik2,nginx,istio,none
INGRESS="traefik2"

#Possible values: (Spaced-Delimited Multiple possible): prometheus grafana jaeger registry k8s-dashboard rio-dashboard istio
TOOLS="prometheus grafana jaeger registry k8s-dashboard"
```

And fire it up with

```bash
./startup.sh
```

For new-comers to linux, or just lazy people like me, install dialog with the package-manager of your choice and run 

```bash
./startup_dialog.sh
```

After the installation your console should tell you the different URLs you should know about, if I didn't miss anything.

## What doesn't work yet / is incomplete or a todo

* Istio Gateway Stuff
    To be honest, I don't fully understand how the Istio Ingress works yet, it just seems much more complicated than traefik/nginx (it's still envoy) which would explain it's brutal amounts of configuration/documentation. 
    I will try to fix the istio ingresses as soon as I get a grasp on how it works
* Concourse
    I want to blame it on concourse, since they don't have an explicit option to configure a proxypath/context-path, but that could be on me too. Documentation get's tough to read after a few hours of struggling and I could have easily missed it too.
* Sample Pipelines for the CD Tools
    Not really a priority as of now, but it would be a nice to have if there were easy to copy files/descriptors for the various CD tools
